# The Pillars of Game Design and Development
### by Carles Homs

"I am [Carles Homs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ch0m5/), student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu)."

## What is a Game Pillar?
A *pillar* is a term used to define an element that serves as a supporting, integral part of something, so we can assume a Game Pillar is a fundamental part of a Game that works as a **foundation** for its design.

However, there isn’t a widely acknowledged definition for what a Game Pillar is supposed to be, and so different uses of the term exist while remaining true to the **pillar** component.

For [Max Pears](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MaxPears/20171012/307469/Design_Pillars__The_Core_of_Your_Game.php), Level Designer at [CD Projekt Red](https://en.cdprojektred.com/), a game pillar is the most **basic elements and emotions** that a game is trying to explore and make the players feel. As an example, he uses [The Last of Us](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-last-of-us-ps3/) and its focus on **narrative** and a partner-like relationship and [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/) and its focus on **exploration and travel**.

While [Ted Price](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/176917/The_4_pillars_of_making_a_truly_great_game_according_to_Insomniac.php), [Insomniac Games](https://insomniac.games/) CEO, talks about them with a perspective that leans towards a more general **design and development process** rather than specific features that make a game unique, like focusing on what your game has that others don't and defining your target audience to make a mental model of your player.

*The relationship between Joel and Ellie is a core narrative element of the game and the experience in The Last of Us.*

### Core Game Elements VS Core Design Guidelines

The first approach is more specific to a certain game, as it revolves around the core elements that will define **the experience the game offers**, while the second one is more general and can be applied to a game regardless of its content. Therefore, we can assume that the 1st perspective sees Game Pillars as game-specific core elements while the 2nd one percieves them as general rulings that mark the foundation of good game development and design.

In this article we will focus on the 2nd perspective, which visualizes a Game Pillar as a general solid base to work on, a **rule of thumb** to follow when designing and producing games on a very raw level. This means that a pillar can be applied to **any** game on production, no matter the specifics of the game like genre, mechanics or thematic, as the pillar covers core aspects present in all games alike.

The book [The Art of Game Design](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123694966/the-art-of-game-design) by [Jesse Schell](https://www.jesseschell.com/) seems to share this perspective of Game Pillars, but he uses the terms ***lenses***, as for him each concept is a different way to look at the design of your game (more than a 100!) and the combination of all of them create an ideal general guideline to follow for any game design.

<p align="center">

</p>
*Schell's scheme that relates all of his design topics. A must-read for any current or future Game Designer.*

That said, the 1st perspective is a perfectly valid one and is a great procedure to follow: defining what core mechanics or elements will define your game will help you steer which direction your **creative process** will go to and quickly identify which ideas add to the desired goals for the game. However, the 2nd one allows you to create your own **design handbook** which you can apply to any game you want to create, making it more polivalent. Something similar to the [12 Principles of Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDqjIdI4bF4), but applied to game development.

I still highly recommend to use **both** to get the best of your game and development process.

## Why do we need them?
A Game Pillar works as a **guideline** to follow throughout the entire design process to see which ideas add to the design goals of the game and which don’t, working as a **filter** to secure the quality of the game and making sure that all new introduced elements add to the desired experience.

Depending on what pillars are stablished, they also define how the development team must work, communicate, and cooperate to make sure the different game elements function in **harmony** even if the team is separated in different sectors and aspects of the game.

On a production perspective, having clear Game Pillars help define all concepts that must be settled during **pre-production** and must be considered every time a new design idea arises. Having strong Game Pillars that are used as reference during the prototyping stages secure that the game has a solid base which can be built upon, adding details and implementing features in the production phase with clear goals in mind so budget and time isn't wasted.

## Existent Examples

Companies create their own Game Pillars to follow and make sure that the game never deviates of this core elements of design that define the experience.

[Blizzard Entertainment's Eight Core Values](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/mission.html) could be considered their 8 Game Pillars: Gameplay First, Commit to Quality, Play Nice & Play Fair, Embrace Your Inner Geek, etc… All these guidelines mark the way Blizzard employees work, make decisions and design their games.

On the other hand, [Bungie](https://www.destinypedia.com/Seven_Pillars_of_Design) created their own guidelines to create **Destiny**: A World Players Want to Be In, A Bunch of Fun Things to Do, Rewards Players Care About, etc…

While Blizzard defines broad guidelines that mark the **design decisions** and **development procedures** of their workers, Bungie focuses primarily on the **player experience** while playing the game, showing that different companies create their **own rules** to follow while making their games.

*Blizzard's Mission Statement has become a symbol of their craftmanship, and their core values are shown on every single game they develop.*

## What's a good Game Pillar?

A good Game Pillar must define a concept that will help to guide and shape the experience that the game wants to transmit, working as a point of reference. This concept can be directed to both game elements and working methodologies to design and implement them.

If a Game Pillar does not accomplish this goal, it’s not a good base or reference to develop a game. For example, I think that [Sergio Rodrigo’s Pillars of Game Development](http://srodrigo.me/the-4-pillars-of-game-development/) tackles concepts that are way too broad: Design, Art, Programming, and Music. They are basic concepts that are too vague and even obvious to work as a personal frame of reference.

## My Approach

As a personal exercise to understand the concept, I decided to create my own Game Pillars based on the information I’ve gathered during this research. With these pillars I try to set the most important bases of general game design that I believe should be applied to any game.

I made them to tackle three main aspects: The core parts of game design that make it a **fun and engaging experience**, the **mechanisms and tools** that can be exploited to implement the design choices flawlessly, and the **work procedures** that must be followed so that the entire team is coordinated and with the same **goals** in mind.

### 1. Create a Unique Experience
* Focus on what emotions you want to transmit, how must the player **feel** while playing the game.
* While brainstorming, think of one idea or feature that you game would have that **no other does**.
* Establish the most important features of the game and a **creative direction** to follow.
* The ideas must **resonate** with you, they must sound fun. Check if they feel like you expected them to do from a **practical standpoint** by prototyping and testing the idea.

</p>
*DOOM was originally made in 1993 providing an experience revolving around movement, extreme violence, and lots of combat options. **23 years later**, they deliver the exact same experience in today's technology standards.*

### 2. Define Your Target Audience
* Evaluate what demographic is your game targeted to. **Who** will play your game?
* What is he **familiar** with? What needs to be **explained**? What is assumed to be **already known**?
* What **skill level should** the game be prepared for? It must be **challenging**, without becoming frustrating nor boring (difficulty flow).
* What theme and aesthetics are best to **appeal** the player's interest? To make your mechanics intuitive and **easy to interiorize**?

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ch0m5/Game-Design-Pillars/master/docs/Arma_3.jpg" width="645"/>
</p>
*Arma 3 is a **Military Simulator** that acknowledges their target audience as players looking for a realistic hardcore military shooter experience. This is reflected in its design, for example in the knowledge and skill level expected from the player.*

### 3. The Core Loop Must Be Inherently Fun
* The series of activities that will be repeated throughout the game must be **fun and satisfying to perform**.
* **Create prototypes** around design ideas and **test them** to see if they work on a **practical level**.
* **Iterate** prototypes over and over until the loop is **solid and polished** so the experience feels like the desired one.
* Each iteration must **answer** a fundamental question and evaluate the combination of all currently present elements.
* Great short guideline: The game should be **Easy to Learn and FUN to Master**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ch0m5/Game-Design-Pillars/master/docs/Super_Mario.jpg" width="645"/>
</p>
*The core loop of Super Mario games is to move and jump. That alone felt satisfying and fun when testing, enough to expand on that idea and create the legendary franchise we know today.*

### 4. Communicate With Your Team: Set Your Goals and Limits
* The core elements of the game must be **understood and acknowledged** by the team to hold a common creative ground.
* Use the GDD to define the **core experience** of the game, **desired goals**, and any important specifications that feel relevant to the game's design to work as a basic reference for the team.
* Establish the objectives, stages, limitations, deadlines, and any other **elements that will affect your schedule**, a game must release at some point and it must be finished by then. **Being prepared for unexpected issues will lessen the damage they do.**
* Set your goals and limits on the **pre-production** phase. Any unplanned changes made in the middle of production will cost money and time, so having a **solid game concept** before entering it is crucial.
* **Share feedback** constantly, even in informal environments, the team must work at unison.
* **All game elements must work towards the same goals in an harmonic fashion.** They must all coordinate to deliver the wanted experience, even if they are managed by different people on the team.

### 5. Make the Game Coherent and Consistent
* A game is **coherent** when its different elements show a **logical consistency** in their nature and behavior when related to each other.
* Relationship between elements must result in potential combinations that the player can **explore and experiment** with.
* Take into account what the player **expects** and his **assumptions** based on common sense and previous experiences.
* Whatever rules your game follows, they must be **consistent** so the player can learn from them and formulate **strategies**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ch0m5/Game-Design-Pillars/master/docs/Halo_Covenant.jpg" width="645"/>
</p>
*Halo showcases different kinds of enemies, each with a very distinctive look and consistent behavior. This allows the player to quickly identify a type of enemy, learn its move and attack patterns, and create tactics around it.*

### 6. Guide the Player: Make it Intuitive without being Obvious
* **Guide** the player through the experience, but **don't hold its hand**, let him explore his options without getting lost.
* Make mechanics **intuitive and easy to learn**. Use **aesthetic and thematic as a channel to teach mechanics**.
* Give **feedback** to the player for his actions, **reinforce** wanted behaviors and **discourage** unwanted ones with care, **you don't want to railroad the player** but certainly limit the options to the desired game experience.
* Provide a **general goal** for the game with **smaller short-term goals** to keep him **engaged and satisfied**.
* Give the player **meaningful rewards** proportionate to the **difficulty** of the challenges he overcomes.
* **Don't overload the player.** Keep things **simple**, not **too many outputs** at the same time, and exploit the different **channels** available (visuals, gameplay, sound) to pass your message through **smoothly**.

*This video by **Game Maker's Toolkit** explains different concepts beautifully that directly relate to player guidance.*

### 7. Let the Player Play
* Let him **explore**, **decide**, and **learn** from his choices**.
* Give him tools and an environment to experiment with, which gives the game **depth** and can result in **emergent gameplay**.
* Use **gameplay as a channel** to transmit the experience. Include the player's actions into the context of the situation so he feels as **his decisions have meaning**, affecting and shaping the world around him.
* Whenever a new element appears for the player to learn, create a **challenge** to test his abilities and knowledge about it.
* **Don't take control away from the player unless it's necessary to the experience**, it can easily become frustrating.

*This video by **Extra Credits** talks about **depth and complexity** and the possibilites that can come out from a single ruleset. This relates to both pillars 6 and 7.*

### 8. Make a Game You're Proud Of
* Seems obvious, but **making a game that you would enjoy playing** is essential to put the needed work into it. Your hands are an engine, your game a goal, and **passion** your fuel.
* Think of the project as a **reflection of your skills**, what heights are you capable to achieve.
* **Commit** to the concept, the ideas, and the desired experience. Don't lower your standards unless you are forced to, but also try to be **realistic** about what you think you are able to achieve.
* Putting your soul into a game gives it one of it's own and **pushes your limits further to make it work**.

## Conclusions and Personal Thoughts

Game Pillars can cover both **specific elements that will be the core of a game's design** and the **general rules to follow when designing and developing any game** so production goes smoothly. Every team or single developer can create his own, it will define his craft, his standards and guidelines, what goals does he want to game to achieve and which experience does he want to deliver to the player.

Having **strong and reliable** Game Pillars will make sure that your ideas and creative direction are **focused** from the very beginning to what you want your game to be. On a professional level, it could save you time and money, as securing the grounds of your game on pre-production via **prototypes and iteration** can avoid problems on the production phase that could **hurt both the budget and the schedule**.
