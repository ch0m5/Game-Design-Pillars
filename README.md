## What is a Game Pillar?
A *pillar* is a term used to define an element that serves as a supporting, integral part of something, so we can assume a Game Pillar is a fundamental part of a Game that works as a **foundation** for its design.

However, there isn’t a widely acknowledged definition for what a Game Pillar is supposed to be, and so different uses of the term exist while remaining true to what a **pillar** is supposed to be.

For [Max Pears]( https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MaxPears/20171012/307469/Design_Pillars__The_Core_of_Your_Game.php), Level Designer at [CD Projekt Red](https://en.cdprojektred.com/), a game pillar is the most **basic elements and emotions** that a game is trying to explore and make the players feel. As an example, he uses [The Last of Us](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-last-of-us-ps3/) and its **crafting** mechanic and [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/) and its focus on **exploration and travel**.

While [Ted Price](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/176917/The_4_pillars_of_making_a_truly_great_game_according_to_Insomniac.php), [Insomniac Games](https://insomniac.games/) CEO, talks about them with a perspective that leans towards a more general **design and development process** rather than specific features that make a game unique, like focusing on what your game has that others don't and defining your target audience to make a mental model of your player.

### Core Game Elements VS Core Design Guidelines

The first approach is more specific to a certain game, as it revolves around the core elements that will define **the experience the game offers**, while the second one is more general and can be applied to a game regardless of its content. Therefore, we can assume that the 1st perspective sees Game Pillars as game-specific core elements while the 2nd one percieves them as general rulings that mark the foundation of good game development and design.

In this article we will focus on the 2nd perspective, which visualizes a Game Pillar as a general solid base to work on, a **rule of thumb** to follow when designing and producing games on a very raw level. This means that a pillar can be applied to **any** game on production, no matter the specifics of the game like genre, mechanics or thematic, as the pillar covers core aspects present in all games alike.

The book [The Art of Game Design](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123694966/the-art-of-game-design) by [Jesse Schell](https://www.jesseschell.com/) seems to share this perspective of Game Pillars, but he uses the terms ***lenses***, as for him each concept is a different way to look at the design of your game (more than a 100!) and the combination of all of them create an ideal general guideline to follow for any game design.

That said, the 1st perspective is a perfectly valid one and is a great procedure to follow: defining what core mechanics or elements will define your game will help you steer which direction your **creative process** will go to and quickly identify which ideas add to the desired goals for the game. However, the 2nd one allows you to create your own **design handbook** which you can apply to any game you want to create, making it more polivalent. Something similar to the [12 Principles of Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDqjIdI4bF4), but applied to game development.

I still highly recommend to use **both** to get the best of your game and development process.

## Why do we need them?
A Game Pillar works as a **guideline** to follow throughout the entire design process to see which ideas add to the design goals of the game and which don’t, working as a **filter** to secure the quality of the game and making sure that all new introduced elements add to the desired experience.

Depending on what pillars are stablished, they also define how the development team must work, communicate, and cooperate to make sure the different game elements function in **harmony** even if the team is separated in different sectors and aspects of the game.

On a production perspective, having clear Game Pillars help define all concepts that must be settled during **pre-production** and must be considered every time a new design idea arises. Having strong Game Pillars that are used as reference during the prototyping stages secure that the game has a solid base which can be built upon, adding details and implementing features in the production phase with clear goals in mind so budget and time isn't wasted.

## Existent Examples

Companies create their own Game Pillars to follow and make sure that the game never deviates of this core elements of design that define the experience.

[Blizzard’s Eight Core Values](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/mission.html) could be considered their 8 Game Pillars: Gameplay First, Commit to Quality, Play Nice & Play Fair, Embrace Your Inner Geek, etc… All these guidelines mark the way Blizzard employees work, make decisions and design their games.

On the other hand, [Bungie](https://www.destinypedia.com/Seven_Pillars_of_Design) created their own guidelines to create **Destiny**: A World Players Want to Be In, A Bunch of Fun Things to Do, Rewards Players Care About, etc…

While Blizzard defines broad guidelines that define the **design decisions** and **development procedures** of their workers, Bungie focuses primarily on the **player experience** while playing the game, showing that different companies create their **own rules** to follow while making their games.

## What is a good Game Pillar?

A good Game Pillar must define a concept that will help to guide and shape the experience that the game wants to transmit, working as a point of reference. This concept can be directed to both game elements and working methodologies to design and implement them.

If a Game Pillar does not accomplish this goal, it’s not a good base or reference to develop a game. For example, I think that [Sergio Rodrigo’s Pillars of Game Development](http://srodrigo.me/the-4-pillars-of-game-development/) tackles concepts that are way too broad: Design, Art, Programming, and Music. They are basic concepts that are too vague and even obvious to work as a personal frame of reference.

## My approach

As a personal exercise to understand the concept, I decided to create my own Game Pillars based on the information I’ve gathered during this research. With these pillars I try to set the most important bases of general game design that I believe should be applied to any game.

I made them to tackle three main aspects: The core aspects of game design that make it a **fun and engaging experience**, the **mechanisms and tools** that can be exploited to implement the design choices flawlessly, and the **work procedures** that must be followed so that the entire team is coordinated and with the same **goals** in mind.

### 1. Create a unique experience
* Focus on what emotions you want to transmit, how must the player **feel** while playing the game.
* While brainstorming, think of one idea or feature that you game would have that **no other does**.
* Establish the most important features of the game and a **creative direction** to follow.
* The ideas must **resonate** with you, they must sound fun. Check if they still feel like expected from a **practical standpoint** by prototyping and testing the idea.

### 2. Define your target audience
* Evaluate what demographic is your game targeted to. **Who** will play your game?
* What is he **familiar** with? What needs to be **explained**? What is assumed to be **already known**?
* What **skill level should** the game be prepared for? It must be **challenging**, without becoming frustrating nor boring (flow).
* What theme and aesthetics are best to **appeal** the player's interest? To make your mechanics intuitive and **easy to interiorize**?

### 3. The core loop must be inherently fun
* The series of activities that will be repeated throught the game must be **fun and satisfying to perform**.
* **Create prototypes** around design ideas and **test them** to see if they work on a **practical level**.
* **Iterate** prototypes over and over until the loop is **solid and polished** so the experience feels like the desired one.
* Each iteration must **answer** a fundamental question and evaluate the combination of all currently present elements.
* Great short guideline: The should be **Easy to learn and FUN to master**.

### 4. Communicate with your team
* The core elements of the game must be **understood and acknowledged** by the team to hold a common creative ground.
* Use the GDD to define the **core experience** of the game, **desired goals**, and any important specifications that feel relevant to the game's design. The document should be short and check only the most essential points, be a design reference for the team.
* **Share feedback** constantly, even in informal environments, the team must work at unison.
* **All game elements must work for the same goals.** They must all coordinate to deliver the wanted experience, even if they are managed by different people on the team.

### 5. Make the game Coherent and Consistent
* A game is **coherent** when its different elements show a **logical consistency** in their nature and behavior when related to each other.
* Relationship between elements must result in potential combinations that the player can **explore and experiment** with.
* Take into account what the player **expects** and his **assumptions** based on common sense and previous experiences.
* Whatever rules your game follows, they must be **consistent** so the player can learn from them and formulate **strategies**.

### 6. Guide the player: Make it intuitive without being obvious
* **Guide** the player through the experience, but **don't hold its hand**, let him explore his options without getting lost.
* Make elements feel **intuitive and easy to learn**. Use **aesthetic and thematic as a channel to teach mechanics**.
* Give **feedback** to the player for his actions, **reinforce** wanted behaviors and **discourage** unwanted ones with care, **you don't want to railroad the player** but certainly limit the options to the desired game experience.
* Provide a **general goal** for the game with **smaller short-term goals** to keep him **engaged and satisfied**.
* Give the player **meaningful rewards** proportionate to the **difficulty** of the challenges he overcomes.
* **Don't overload the player.** Keep things **simple**, not **too many outputs** at the same time, and exploit the different **channels** available (visuals, gameplay, sound) to pass your message through **smoothly**.

### 7. Let the player play
* Let him **explore, decide, and learn from his choices**.
* Give him tools and an environment to experiment with, which can result in **emergent gameplay**.
* Use **gameplay as a channel** to transmit the experience. Include the player's actions into the context of the situation so he feels as **his decisions have meaning**, affecting and shaping the world around him.
* Whenever a new element appears for the player to learn, create a **challenge** to test his abilities and knowledge about it.
* **Don't take control away from the player unless it's necessary to the experience**, it can easily become frustrating.
