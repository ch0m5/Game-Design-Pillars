## What is a Game Pillar?
A *pillar* is a term used to define an element that serves as a supporting, integral part of something, so we can assume a Game Pillar is a fundamental part of a Game that works as a foundation for its design.

However, there isn’t a widely acknowledged definition for what a Game Pillar is supposed to be, and so different uses of the term exist while remaining true to what a **pillar** is supposed to be.

For [Max Pears]( https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MaxPears/20171012/307469/Design_Pillars__The_Core_of_Your_Game.php), Level Designer at [CD Projekt Red](https://en.cdprojektred.com/), a game pillar is the most basic elements and emotions that a game is trying to explore and make the players feel.

While [Ted Price](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/176917/The_4_pillars_of_making_a_truly_great_game_according_to_Insomniac.php), [Insomniac Games](https://insomniac.games/) CEO, talks about them with a perspective that leans towards the development process rather than specific features that make a game unique.

In this article we will focus on the 2nd perspective, which visualizes a Game Pillar as a general solid base to work on, a rule of thumb to follow when designing and producing games on a very raw level. This means that a pillar can be applied to **any** game on production, no matter the specifics of the game like genre, mechanics or thematic, as the pillar covers core aspects present in all games alike.

## Why do we need then is a Game Pillar?
Because of reasons
