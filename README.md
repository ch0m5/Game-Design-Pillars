# The Pillars of Game Design and Development
### by Carles Homs

“I am [Carles Homs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ch0m5/), student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu).”

## What is a Game Pillar?
A *pillar* is a term used to define an element that serves as a supporting, integral part of something, so we can assume a Game Pillar is a fundamental part of a Game that works as a **foundation** for its design.

However, there isn’t a widely acknowledged definition for what a Game Pillar is supposed to be, and so different uses of the term exist while remaining true to what a **pillar** is supposed to be.

For [Max Pears]( https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MaxPears/20171012/307469/Design_Pillars__The_Core_of_Your_Game.php), Level Designer at [CD Projekt Red](https://en.cdprojektred.com/), a game pillar is the most **basic elements and emotions** that a game is trying to explore and make the players feel.

While [Ted Price](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/176917/The_4_pillars_of_making_a_truly_great_game_according_to_Insomniac.php), [Insomniac Games](https://insomniac.games/) CEO, talks about them with a perspective that leans towards the **development process** rather than specific features that make a game unique.

The first approach is more specific to a certain game, as it revolves around the core elements that will define **the experience the game offers**, while the second one is more general and can be applied to a game regardless of its content. Therefore, we can assume that the 1st perspective sees Game Pillars as game-specific core elements while the 2nd one percieves them as general rulings that mark the foundation of good game development and design.

In this article we will focus on the 2nd perspective, which visualizes a Game Pillar as a general solid base to work on, a **rule of thumb** to follow when designing and producing games on a very raw level. This means that a pillar can be applied to **any** game on production, no matter the specifics of the game like genre, mechanics or thematic, as the pillar covers core aspects present in all games alike.

That said, the 1st perspective is a perfectly valid one and is a great procedure to follow: defining what core mechanics or elements will define your game will help you steer which direction your creative process will go to and quickly identify which ideas add to the desired goals for the game. However, the 2nd one allows you to create your own **design handbook** which you can apply to any game you want to create, making it more polivalent. Something similar to the [12 Principles of Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDqjIdI4bF4), but applied to game development.

I still highly recommend to use **both** to get the best of your game and development process.

## Why do we need them?
A Game Pillar works as a **guideline** to follow throughout the entire design process to see which ideas add to the design goals of the game and which don’t, working as a **filter** to secure the quality of the game and making sure that all new introduced elements add to the desired experience.

Depending on what pillars are stablished, they also define how the development team must work, communicate, and cooperate to make sure the different game elements function in **harmony** even if the team is separated in different sectors and aspects of the game.

On a production perspective, having clear Game Pillars define all concepts that must be settled during **pre-production** and consider every time a new design idea arises. Having strong Game Pillars that are handled during the prototyping stages secure that the game has a strong, solid base which can be built upon, adding details and implementing features with the available budget with clear goals in mind.

## Existent Examples

Companies create their own Game Pillars to follow and make sure that the game never deviates of this core elements of design that define the experience.

[Blizzard’s Eight Core Values](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/mission.html) could be considered their 8 Game Pillars: Gameplay First, Commit to Quality, Play Nice & Play Fair, Embrace Your Inner Geek, etc… All these guidelines mark the way Blizzard employees work, make decisions and design their games.

On the other hand, [Bungie](https://www.destinypedia.com/Seven_Pillars_of_Design) created their own guidelines to create **Destiny**: A World Players Want to Be In, A Bunch of Fun Things to Do, Rewards Players Care About, etc…

While Blizzard defines broad guidelines that define the **design decisions** and **development procedures** of their workers, Bungie focuses primarily on the **player experience** while playing the game, showing that different companies create their **own rules** to follow while making their games.

## What is a good Game Pillar?

A good Game Pillar must define a concept that will help to guide and shape the experience that the game wants to transmit, working as a point of reference. This concept can be directed to both game elements and working methodologies to design and implement them.

If a Game Pillar does not accomplish this goal, it’s not a good base or reference to develop a game. For example, I think that [Sergio Rodrigo’s Pillars of Game Development](http://srodrigo.me/the-4-pillars-of-game-development/) tackles concepts that are way too broad: Design, Art, Programming, and Music. They are basic concepts that are too vague and even obvious to work as a personal frame of reference.

## My approach

As a personal exercise to understand the concept, I decided to create my own Game Pillars based on the information I’ve gathered during this research about Game Design, Game Development, and Work Procedures. With this Pillars I try to set the most important bases of general game design should be applied to any game.

I made them to tackle three main aspects: The core aspects of game design that make it a fun and engaging experience, the mechanisms and tools that can be exploited to implement the design choices flawlessly, and the work procedures that must be followed so that the entire team is coordinated and with the same goals.

### 1. Create a unique experience
